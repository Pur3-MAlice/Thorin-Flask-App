    <p>
        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest
        in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when
        Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
        Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
        Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
        action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned
        to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in
                his youth, Thorin and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug,
                in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to into a capable warrior. This was demonstrated at the
                Battle of Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's
                East-gate, and at some point in the battle, his shield broke, and, using an oaken tree branch found on
                the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which remained with him even in death.

            <p>
                Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. They were also
                nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing
                feature was his long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.
                As the youngest Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli had the sharpest eyes, and were often sent scouting or searching.
                It was they that found the Front Porch while in the Misty Mountains.

                A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest

                He later went to re-establish the Dwarf presence in Moria, but within five years it was overcome once
                more by Orcs, and he was killed there along with the rest of his companions.
